## Work in progress

# I am currently working on an assesment using Vue 3 (with JavaScript). This is my 1st project using Vue, there are a lot of learnings and testing along the way.

# In the coming week, I will add three news features, upload the photo of the house, the option to edit and delete a house listing.
